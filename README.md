### Tutorial 02

[Creating models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial02/#creating-models)

> Django follows the DRY Principle. The goal is to define your data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.

> This includes the migrations - unlike in Ruby On Rails, for example, migrations are entirely derived from your models file,
  and are essentially a history that Django can roll through to update your database schema to match your current models.

Create Migration of the polls model

```
$ python manage.py makemigrations polls
```

See SQL generated by migration

```
$ python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
```

Migrate the model

```
python manage.py migrate
```
> The migrate command takes all the migrations that havenâ€™t been applied (Django tracks which ones are applied using a special table
  in your database called django_migrations) and runs them against your database - essentially, synchronizing the changes you made
  to your models with the schema in the database.
