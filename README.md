3.0.4
```

### Tutorial 01

[Creating a project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/)

```
$ django-admin startproject mysite
```

Run server on a specific port

```
$ python manage.py runserver 8080
```

Migrate the database
```
$ python manage.py migrate
```

### Polls app

[Creating the polls app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/#creating-the-polls-app)

```
$ python manage.py startapp polls
```

* Add a view [polls/views.py](/mysite/polls/views.py)
* Add url to [polls/urls.py](/mysite/polls/urls.py)
* Add app polls to mysite [mysite/urls.py](/mysite/mysite/urls.py)
* Add app polls to mysite [mysite/urls.py](/mysite/mysite/urls.py)

Verify
```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Visit [http://localhost:8000/polls/](http://localhost:8000/polls/)

### Tutorial 02

[Creating models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial02/#creating-models)

> Django follows the DRY Principle. The goal is to define your data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.

> This includes the migrations - unlike in Ruby On Rails, for example, migrations are entirely derived from your models file,
  and are essentially a history that Django can roll through to update your database schema to match your current models.

Create Migration of the polls model

```
$ python manage.py makemigrations polls
```

See SQL generated by migration

```
$ python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
```

Migrate the model

```
python manage.py migrate
```
> The migrate command takes all the migrations that haven’t been applied (Django tracks which ones are applied using a special table
  in your database called django_migrations) and runs them against your database - essentially, synchronizing the changes you made
  to your models with the schema in the database.

### Playing with the api

[Playing with the api](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial02/#playing-with-the-api)

```
$ python manage.py shell
```

```
>>> from polls.models import Choice, Question  # Import the model classes we just wrote.

# No questions are in the system yet.
>>> Question.objects.all()

# Create a new Question.
# Support for time zones is enabled in the default settings file, so
# Django expects a datetime with tzinfo for pub_date. Use timezone.now()
# instead of datetime.datetime.now() and it will do the right thing.
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> q = Question(question_text="What's new?", pub_date=timezone.now())

# Save the object into the database. You have to call save() explicitly.
>>> q.save()

# Now it has an ID.
>>> q.id

# Access model field values via Python attributes.
>>> q.question_text
>>> q.pub_date

# Change values by changing the attributes, then calling save().
>>> q.question_text = "What's up?"
>>> q.save()

# objects.all() displays all the questions in the database.
>>> Question.objects.all()
```

### __str__()

> Wait a minute. <Question: Question object (1)> isn’t a helpful representation of this object.

```
>>> Question.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Question: Question object (1)>]>
```

> adding a __str__() method to both Question and Choice

```
from django.db import models

class Question(models.Model):
    # ...
    def __str__(self):
        return self.question_text

class Choice(models.Model):
    # ...
    def __str__(self):
        return self.choice_text
```
